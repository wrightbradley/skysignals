# Receiving FM Broadcast Radio on the Baofeng UV-5R

The Baofeng UV-5R can receive standard FM broadcast radio stations (such as
music, news, and talk radio) in addition to its VHF/UHF capabilities. This
feature is useful for entertainment, news, and emergency information when other
sources are unavailable.

## Supported Frequency Range

- **FM Broadcast Band:** 65â€“108 MHz (actual range may vary by model/firmware)
- **Mode:** Receive only (mono audio)
- **Note:** FM broadcast cannot be stored as a memory channel; it is only
  accessible in VFO (frequency) mode.

## How to Listen to FM Radio

1. **Turn on the radio.**
2. **Press the [FM] button** (sometimes labeled [CALL] or [MONI] depending on
   your model). The display will switch to the FM broadcast band.
3. **Tune to a station:**
   - Use the up/down arrow keys to scan for stations.
   - Or, enter a frequency directly using the keypad (e.g., `102700` for 102.7
     MHz).
4. **To return to normal radio operation,** press the [FM] button again.

## Tips and Limitations

- **Antenna:** The stock antenna works for local FM stations, but a longer
  antenna may improve reception.
- **Audio:** Output is mono, not stereo.
- **No memory storage:** You cannot save FM stations as memory channels.
- **Emergency use:** FM radio can provide news and alerts during disasters when
  other communications are down.

## Troubleshooting

- If you hear static, try adjusting the antenna or moving to a different
  location.
- If the [FM] button does not work, check your model/firmware; some variants may
  not support FM broadcast.

## Legal Note

- Receiving FM broadcast radio is legal in all regions. You are not transmitting
  when listening to FM radio.
