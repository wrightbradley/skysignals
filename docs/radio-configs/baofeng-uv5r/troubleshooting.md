**Solutions**:

1. **Cable Issues**
   - Try different programming cable
   - Check for loose connections
   - Clean connector contacts

2. **Software Issues**
   - Update to latest CHIRP version
   - Try older CHIRP version if latest fails
   - Close antivirus temporarily

3. **Radio Issues**
   - Factory reset radio first
   - Try programming in smaller batches
   - Ensure battery is fully charged

### Import/Export Errors

#### CSV Format Errors

**Symptoms**: "Invalid format" or "Cannot parse" errors

**Solutions**:

1. **Use Exact Files**
   - Download fresh copy of configuration
   - Don't modify CSV in Excel (use text editor)
   - Check file encoding (UTF-8)

2. **Column Mapping**
   - Verify all required columns present
   - Check for extra/missing commas
   - Ensure frequency format is correct

#### Frequency Range Errors

**Symptoms**: "Frequency out of range" warnings

**Solutions**:

1. **Check Radio Limits**
   - VHF: 136-174 MHz only
   - UHF: 400-520 MHz only
   - Remove out-of-band frequencies

2. **Regional Variations**
   - Some UV-5R variants have different ranges
   - Check your specific model specifications

   - Try different antenna
   - Ensure antenna is properly extended

2. **Squelch Settings**
   - Adjust squelch level (Menu 0)
   - Turn squelch off temporarily to test
   - Check if signal is actually present

3. **Location/Environment**
   - Move to higher elevation
   - Move away from electronic interference
   - Check if others can receive same frequency

### Tones Not Working

**Symptoms**: Can hear traffic but squelch doesn't open

**Solutions**:

1. **Tone Settings**
   - Verify correct CTCSS/DCS tone in channel
   - Check if tone is on transmit, receive, or both
